Rather than performing new computational analyses, the purpose of this work is to map, organize, and critically appraise the existing MR evidence across various organ systems. The book is designed to: - Summarize published MR findings related to T2DM risk factors and outcomes; - Evaluate the strength, consistency, and limitations of causal evidence; - Offer readers an accessible, reproducible, and visually guided exploration of T2DM’s causal landscape; - Identify methodological patterns and knowledge gaps that inform future research directions. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic and heterogeneous metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or both. Beyond glycemic control, T2DM exerts systemic effects across nearly every physiological domain—metabolic, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological, musculoskeletal, immune, and reproductive—leading to a broad spectrum of comorbidities. Globally, the prevalence of T2DM continues to rise, affecting more than half a billion adults and imposing an immense clinical and socioeconomic burden on health systems worldwide. While epidemiological research has long identified associations between T2DM and a wide range of diseases, these associations are often confounded by shared risk factors such as obesity, diet, and lifestyle, as well as by reverse causation. Disentangling these complex relationships is essential to determine whether T2DM itself causally contributes to secondary disorders, or whether both share common biological pathways. Mendelian randomization (MR) provides an innovative framework to strengthen causal inference in this context. By using germline genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR can approximate the effect of a modifiable exposure—such as T2DM liability, insulin resistance, or hyperglycemia—on diverse health outcomes. Because genetic variants are randomly assorted at conception, MR is less susceptible to confounding and temporal ambiguity, offering a quasi-experimental approach to understanding disease causality. Over the past decade, MR studies have rapidly expanded in both scope and resolution, exploring the bidirectional causal interplay between T2DM and a wide variety of disorders across organ systems. However, these studies are dispersed across multiple domains, vary in analytical design, and often yield inconsistent findings. Synthesizing this evidence is crucial to map the broader network of causal relationships that link T2DM with systemic health outcomes. This scoping review systematically organizes and interprets existing MR evidence connecting T2DM with biological systems and disease categories. Each chapter of this book corresponds to a specific physiological or pathological domain, enabling a comprehensive yet structured exploration of the causal landscape. The thematic sections include: S1–S2: Nutritional status and factors influencing health or healthcare contact S3–S4: Endocrine disorders and metabolic intermediates S5–S7: Circulatory, musculoskeletal, and neurological disorders S8–S10: Mental, behavioural, neurodevelopmental, digestive, and visual system disorders S11–S13: Neoplasms, respiratory, and sexual health disorders S14–S16: Infectious, sleep-related, and perinatal conditions S17–S18: Genitourinary and immune system disorders S19–S21: Developmental anomalies, pregnancy-related conditions, and skin disorders Within each domain, the review synthesizes MR findings to highlight consistent causal pathways, conflicting results, and areas of uncertainty. Together, these sections provide a panoramic view of how genetic predisposition to T2DM—and its metabolic correlates—interacts with diverse physiological systems. The overarching aim of this book is not to generate new analyses but to integrate, contextualize, and critically evaluate the expanding body of MR literature on T2DM. By aligning evidence from multiple disease systems, this review seeks to: Map the scope and diversity of MR findings related to T2DM; Identify robust causal associations and unresolved inconsistencies; Evaluate methodological quality, bias sources, and analytical limitations; Provide an accessible, system-level synthesis to guide future research and clinical translation. Ultimately, this work offers a structured and comprehensive overview of the causal links between T2DM and multisystem disorders, bridging epidemiological genetics with clinical insight and highlighting the interconnected nature of metabolic disease.
